## abstract  

This Project started with the vision to combine two senses. Sound exists all around us and gets distorted in various ways. We wanted to make that distortion not visible, but connect the feeling we have on the tips of our fingers with our hearing. This distortion carries an emotional connection, as humans often do to sound. So the challenge of being able to change a sound by texture not only in it’s distortion, but also in its emotionality gets explored in this project.
