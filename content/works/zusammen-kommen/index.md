## abstract

conversations and discussions, both private and public, are cha- racterized by polarization. it is becoming increasingly difficult to deal with content and opinions that do not correspond to one›s own. this is reinforced by algo- rithms that favour polarizing con- tent and by the tendency to rate statements that correspond to one›s own world view as more li- kely to be true.  
zusammen.kommen explores how collaborative design proces- ses can create rituals in which ex- change about different attitudes and realities of life can bring about cohesion instead of isolation.
