## abstract  

In their work, the group draws its essence from the childhood icon of a pillow fort, that everyone has experienced in some form or the other. The work comprises of a deconstructed visual and experiential installation of a pillow fort, with accompanying background sounds and vocals inside. They generate a feeling of being protected inside of a fort, but with a keen awareness of the exposed lower half outside of the fort, thereby emphasizing the dichotomy and duality of a protective regime that also encompasses, quite unavoidably and not always in a desirable manner, the concept of separation and boundaries.
