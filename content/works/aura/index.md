After thinking about the idea of a sexy dress that lights up, we realized that we especially had our difficulties with the word „sexy“.
Since the definition of sexy undergoes constant change, is subjective and mostly very exclusive, we decided, we wanted to design a wearable, adjustable to most body-types. With this we highlight the sexiness of movement and light, rather than limiting sexiness to a specific definition tied to external factors, such as body type.

With silicone thread and glass fibres, sown to a straight-cut dress, a mesh sleeve and an adjustable harness, we lit up different parts of the body. To make the light react to movement, we installed a gyro sensor on the right arm and connected it to an Arduino, wich in turn controlled the LEDs.
