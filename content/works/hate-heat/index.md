## abstract  

**HATE** and the feeling of hatred, especially against groups and peoples often stems from a very deep-rooted fear of otherness. This angst of opening up and interacting with one another about differences in culture or interests leads to ever deeper misunderstandings.
The **HEAT** of an argument, heat from a fire, the sun’s heat – although sometimes greatly de- structive, is what has the potential to bring us to a new level of understanding and tolerance.


## description   

On the basis of the ongoing study on hate-speech by the Department of Political Science at University of Zurich we developped posters as a class concerning hate speech on the internet.  
We approached the topic by finding anagrams linked to hate speech and landed on HATE – HEAT.  
For the exhibition ['planet digital'](https://www.planetdigital.ch/en/) we designed an interactive poster for three screens and motion tracking using p5.js.

The typeface was designed by ourselves and aimed to evoke a feeling of 'hate-nostalgia', drawing inspiration from the political posters by hubertus design for the campaign against the "durchsetzungs-initiative". 
The movement of the letters was chosen to conjure the feeling of breathing, living things so as to simulate the closeness to real-life that persists.
Code written by Luke Franzke was used to get the information of the motion detection to map onto our design.
