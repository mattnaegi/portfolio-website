## abstract  

To tackle the course topic of "systemic change", we considered the notion that only artistically talented people should pursue creativity, as we believe that being creative is important for everyone. We created a "quatsch" (nonsense) event where people could be freely creative, with materials such as paint or wood, and free of expectations.  


## description  

To tackle the topic of this year’s Interaction Design Process module, “systemic change”, we challenged the notion that one should only be creative if one is really good at it, so much so that one could potentially monetise it. Through community and creativity, we wanted to encourage the deconstruction of this capitalist notion. Therefore, our target audience consisted of people who are not typically creative and have day jobs that are unrelated to art, such as office jobs. Having an outlet of creativity is important for everyone.

Through an event of quatsch-making (quatsch = nonsense), where people could join and do anything they wanted, we created a space where people could comfortably connect with their creativity without expectations and learn to see themselves as creative. We provided materials such as paint, wood, and power tools, and provided free food and drinks to create an event that was inviting for socialising and free of expectations.

With the enclosed booklet ("Make Quatsch! A Documented Guide"), anyone can follow suit in creating such an event.
