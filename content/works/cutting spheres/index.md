## abstract  
以不同的方式切割球体，用金属板制作了一套两个杯子（铜和银 925）和一个容器（铜）。
使用锻造、折叠和焊接技术，出现了三个用平面或体积切割的容器，让人想起天体和几何研究。

## description  
Our final task in the third semester course 《锻造手工课》(smithing class) was to create three everyday objects and change their forms into something interesting.  
After sketching and getting a design recommendation I started by first making a big copper bowl that is very rounded at the bottom and has straight sides. I then halved the bowl and attatched both sides to a sheet of copper that was later folded up to form one big vessel with a space between the bowlhalves.
For the two cups that I wanted to make to accompany the bigger bowl/vase I decided to take the form of the bowl and make it smaller. With the same proportions (4:5) I made the cups out of 9cm diameter circular sheets. To stay in the topic of sliced volumes, I decided for visually cut- ting the cups with a sheet of metal that gives an interesting shift aswell in the balance of the cup. One is made from silver, the other from copper.  
Especially challenging for me in this homework was soldering and time-management: everythin took a lot longer than anticipated. I think this is also partly due to me not having all ther tools that could make my process faster at times.
