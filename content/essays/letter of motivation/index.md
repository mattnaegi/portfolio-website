## on my interests and strengths		
For as long as I can remember I have been interested in the intersections between different disciplines. I enjoy collaboratively finding overlaps or interesting similarities between fields, or even trying to connect fields that have no overlaps, as a designer and a sort of mediator. I enjoy visualizing topics in an interesting and understandable way so that things which might be hard to understand become more tangible.  
I am motivated by learning new skills and combining my collection of knowledge, artifacts and ideas to create something that might feel new or give a new perspective.  
Through my commitment to a topic and to my teammates I am able to inspire and motivate while learning and growing.				

## on my motivation					
I have had the privilege of being able to change my lifeâ€˜s trajectory multiple times over the last few years to cater to this search of various ideas and ways of looking at the world. What might seem like an unusual and detour-rich path on my CV, to me, has been an experience of learning evernew things and taking the parts that I find most interesting with me. 
On top of the transcultural and interdisciplinary collaboration that has motivated me for a long time, I am especially intrigued to further deepen my understanding and appreciation for cultures different to the one I grew up in.  
Having spent half a year in Shanghai studying Mandarin in 2017, I am looking forward to seeing how my perception and experience might have changed coming back to the PRC. On top of that, I am intrigued to find where my western-, ZHdK-influenced artistic practice and knowledge might differ from and where they might complement what I will learn at CAA.	

## on my hopes for my exchange at CAA			
In the process of choosing a school and study field that interests me for an exchange I stumbled upon Jewelry Design at CAA and immediately felt drawn to it. I enjoy jewelry and wearables and their design a lot. All the while loving the emotional value they can hold for some and the sheer beauty and intricacy of jewelry pieces the most.  
During my short internship as a gold- and silversmith at Parolari Goldschmied AG, I was able to learn a lot of basics in working with metals and precious stones. I am excited to deepen this knowledge and these skills at a school as prestigious as CAA.  
Although jewelry design seems to be quite far away from interaction design, finding the connections and contrasts between the two is exactly what motivates me.  
I am eager to take this opportunity to not only get to know a different kind of design and aesthetic, but to deepen my knowledge and craft-skills in jewelry design, as well as learning a new way of looking at and making sense of the world around me.
