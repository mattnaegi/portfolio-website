**m**atthias (all pronouns)

i like to make projects in different areas, taking inspiration from wherever it's coming from.
i love working in teams.  

i am motivated by finding symbioses between analogue and digital.  

working with arduino, low-fi electrical engineering, processing, light fixtures, "trash", ..., i like to expand our perceptions and views on our surroundings and internal processes.
